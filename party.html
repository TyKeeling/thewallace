	The party of parties! Lets all get together celebrate the end of the
	semester, and the beginning of summer! ☀️
</p>

<p>
	Theme: that's right, it's tight and bright! But really, anything 80's
	works for us. Break out those vintage headbands, dust off that walkman,
	bring <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NGjlUop.jpg">that cup</a>. I'm trying
	to keep this an open and welcoming event, so please feel free to bring
	your chillest and most respectful friends.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Date: Friday, April 29</li>
	<li>Time: 8:58 until late</li>
	<li>Location: The Wallace (Dunbar Area, address will be posted the day of)</li>
	<li>Cost: $5 to cover bar costs + glow sticks. We do not have tap so please bring cash.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you don't wear anything tight or bright, the cost is
			$10 since you're gonna need a lot of glow sticks to fit in
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:50px"><a href="darulez.html">RSVP Here</a></p>
