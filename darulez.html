<ul>
	<li>
		This is a shared space with some of the best people in Vancouver. Please
		treat this place with respect as if you were living here as well.
	</li>
	<li>
		Please come in your best and brightest outfits (and smiles). You have seen my
		fashion recommendations but you do you.
	</li>
	<li>
		Please do not go downstairs or open any doors that are closed.
	</li>
	<li>
		We live in a neighbourhood of retirees. To avoid any noise complaints, please
		keep voices down when in outside spaces. There will be a fire pit and some
		games outside (weather dependent)
	</li>
	<li>
		Please bring $5 cash to help pay for decorations and 2 drinks from the house bar.
		You'll likely want to bring your own alcohol as well.
	</li>
	<li>
		Friends are welcome and lovely! Just please RSVP so we can get a sense of how many
		guests to expect
	</li>
</ul>
