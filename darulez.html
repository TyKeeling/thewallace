	Please read Rulez:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		This is a shared space with some of the best people in Vancouver. Please
		treat this place with respect as if you were living here as well.
	</li>
	<li>
		Please do not open any doors that are closed. There will be some house beer
		available but please bring your own substances to supplement and share :)
	</li>
	<li>
		We live in a neighbourhood of retirees. To avoid any noise complaints, please
		keep voices down when in outside spaces. There will be a fire pit and some
		games outside (weather dependent)
	</li>
	<li>
		Friends are welcome and lovely - Just please RSVP so we can get a sense of how many
		guests to expect
	</li>
</ul>
